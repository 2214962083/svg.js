# Bug report

- What is the expected behaviour?

- What error message are you getting?
- Modify [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Fuzzy/s06mfv5u/) to demonstrate the problem clearly, just fork it and paste the resulting fiddle in your issue.

# Feature request

## Drawing [Smiley the Meme](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/107/smily.jpg)

It would be cool if SVG.js could be used to easily draw smiley the meme, it would make my life so much easier when I want to have memes in my svg.

### Benefits
- Drawing memes would be quick and easy
- Memes are funny

I think the syntax to achieve this should be:

```js
let meme = draw.meme({radius: 300, cx: 50, cy: 80, lookAt: [30, 50]})
```

Then the user could easily change where the smiley is looking with:

```js
meme.lookAt(50, 40)
// OR
meme.lookAt([30, 20])
// OR
meme.lookAt(new SVG.Point(30, 20))
```
